Hi everyone! This is my first app I've ever created-and it was done by following alongside Kameni's instructions during the Snap Engineering Lab, 2025. 
The link for the Zoom recording can be found here: https://vimeo.com/1065705681
Although this was challenging for me since I had no prior knowledge of Swift, and only started coding about 3 months ago, it was an extremely welcome challenge and I am very proud of myself for following through.

Although there are still changes to be desired here, I look forward to more projects where I can practice making apps, other small games, etc, to get my feet wet!
