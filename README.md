Hi everyone! This is my first app I've ever created-and it was done by following alongside Kameni's instructions during the Snap Engineering Lab, 2025. 
The link for the Zoom recording can be found here: https://vimeo.com/1065705681 .
Although this was challenging for me since I had no prior knowledge of Swift, and only started coding about 3 months ago, it was an extremely welcome challenge and I am very proud of myself for following through.

This app is made for iOS, MacOS, iPad, and Apple Vision on iPad. 
It uses an API call, to get Air Quality Index from IQAir. Currently, it can only pull data from Los Angeles, CA, but I will be updating it to pull data with user input in the near future once my school schedule clears up a little. 

Although there are still changes to be desired here, I look forward to more projects where I can practice making apps, other small games, etc, to get my feet wet!
